# tetris_flutter

This Flutter project presents a classic Tetris game with core gameplay features. It utilizes a grid-based game board where Tetromino pieces descend, allowing players to manipulate their movement and rotation. The game incorporates collision detection, line clearing mechanics, scoring, and game over conditions. Pause and exit functionalities are also provided for user control.

Key Features:
Classic Tetris Gameplay: Authentic recreation of the iconic Tetris experience.
Tetromino Manipulation: Players can move and rotate pieces for strategic placement.
Line Clearing and Scoring: Completed lines are cleared, and points are awarded.
Game Over and Reset: The game ends when pieces reach the top, with the option to restart.
Pause and Exit Options: Users can pause the game and exit gracefully.

Technical Highlights:
Flutter Framework: Developed using Dart and the Flutter UI toolkit.
Grid-based Board: GridView.builder dynamically renders the game board.
Custom Game Logic: Piece movement, collision detection, and scoring are implemented.
State Management: setState is employed for UI updates.
Optional Audio: The project can integrate audio effects using audioplayers (currently commented out).
