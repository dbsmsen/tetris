# tetris_flutter

This Flutter project delivers a classic Tetris game experience, featuring a grid-based board where players strategically manipulate falling Tetromino pieces. The implementation incorporates core Tetris mechanics, including piece movement and rotation, collision detection, line clearing for scoring, and game over conditions. User controls are provided for pausing and exiting the game. Technically, the project leverages the Flutter framework with a GridView.builder for dynamic board rendering. Custom game logic handles piece manipulation, collision detection, and score tracking. State management utilizes setState for UI updates, and optional audio integration is available via audioplayers. This project showcases a functional and engaging Tetris game built with Flutter, suitable as a foundation for further development and enhancements
